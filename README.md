# Real Time Chat 
Objective:
Create a web application made in Flask that allows users to chat in real time, messages are stored in PostreSQL database.  
Add NLP to generate text messages (Optional)  

Thoughts:  
.ini files are for changing parameters (e.g params for connection to sql database) without need to change code of the app
