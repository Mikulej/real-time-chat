# Real Time Chat 
Objective:
Create a web application made in Flask that allows users to chat in real time, messages are stored in PostreSQL database.
Add NLP to generate text messages (Optional)

Thoughts:
.ini files are for changing parameters (e.g params for connection to sql database) without need to change code of the app

Steps:
Connect to PostgreSQL DONE
Store sent messages
Display chat logs by fetchin data from database
Save chat room for later, load it with messages from database, table of chat room with relation to table of messages?
Build more web app features
